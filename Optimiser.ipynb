    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Computes the gradient with respect to a single training example.\n",
    "Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Computes the gradient with respect to a small subset of the training data.\n",
    "Differences and tradeoffs: SGD converges faster per iteration but is noisy, while batch gradient descent is stable but computationally expensive. Mini-batch strikes a balance between the two.\n",
    "Q3. Describe the challenges associated with traditional gradient descent optimization methods (e.g., slow convergence, local minima). How do modern optimizers address these challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges: Slow convergence due to oscillations near the minimum, getting stuck in local minima, sensitivity to learning rate.\n",
    "Modern optimizers address these challenges by introducing adaptive learning rates, momentum, and other techniques to accelerate convergence and escape local minima.\n",
    "Q4. Discuss the concepts of momentum and learning rate in the context of optimization algorithms. How do they impact convergence and model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum: Momentum adds inertia to the optimization process, allowing the optimizer to continue moving in the direction of previous gradients, which helps accelerate convergence.\n",
    "Learning rate: Learning rate determines the size of the steps taken during optimization. Too high a learning rate can lead to overshooting the minimum, while too low a learning rate can slow down convergence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Q5. Explain the concept of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its advantages compared to traditional gradient descent. Discuss its limitations and scenarios where it is most suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGD updates the parameters based on the gradient of the loss function computed on a single training example. Its advantages include faster convergence per iteration and reduced memory requirements. However, it is noisy and can be sensitive to the learning rate.\n",
    "Q6. Describe the concept of Adam optimizer and how it combines momentum and adaptive learning rates. Discuss its benefits and potential drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam optimizer combines momentum and adaptive learning rates by maintaining separate moving averages of gradients and squared gradients. This allows it to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. Its benefits include fast convergence and robustness to noisy gradients, but it may require tuning of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Q7. Explain the concept of RMSprop optimizer and how it addresses the challenges of adaptive learning rates. Compare it with Adam and discuss their relative strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSprop optimizer divides the learning rate by the moving average of the squared gradients for each parameter. It addresses the challenges of adaptive learning rates by scaling the learning rate based on the magnitude of recent gradients. Compared to Adam, RMSprop has simpler computations and may be more stable for some tasks, but it may converge slower.\n",
    "Part 3: Applying Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Implement SGD, Adam, and RMSprop optimizers in a deep learning model using a framework of your choice. Train the model on a suitable dataset and compare their impact on model convergence and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement each optimizer in a neural network model and train it on a dataset. Compare their convergence speed, stability, and final performance metrics such as accuracy or loss on a validation set.\n",
    "Q9. Discuss the considerations and tradeoffs when choosing the appropriate optimizer for a given neural network architecture and task. Consider factors such as convergence speed, stability, and generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the characteristics of the dataset, such as size and complexity, as well as the architecture of the neural network. Choose an optimizer based on factors such as convergence speed, stability, and generalization performance. Experiment with different optimizers and hyperparameters to find the best combination for the task at hand."
